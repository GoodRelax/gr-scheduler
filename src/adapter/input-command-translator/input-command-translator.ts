// The signature of what this file publishes is owned here, not in the
// specification (CR-146). Chapter 6.1 owns the boundary values, and the rule a
// member obeys stays with the requirement that states it.

// Nothing outside this folder may import any other file in it
// (Chapter 5.3, MUST NOT), so every name the component publishes
// leaves through here.
//
// The seam declared in this folder is re-exported here because
// the layer that implements it may not reach past this file
// (Chapter 5.3, MUST).
